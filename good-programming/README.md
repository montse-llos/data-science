# Best practices in Programming

## The Zen of Python
by <a href="https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" target="_blank">Tim Peters</a>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful is better than ugly.
<li>Explicit is better than implicit.
<li>Simple is better than complex.
<li>Complex is better than complicated.
<li>Flat is better than nested.
<li>Sparse is better than dense.
<li>Readability counts.
<li>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
<li>Although practicality beats purity.
<li>Errors should never pass silently.
<li>Unless explicitly silenced.
<li>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
<li>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
<li>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
<li>Now is better than never.
<li>Although never is often better than *right* now.
<li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
<li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
<li>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
</ul>
